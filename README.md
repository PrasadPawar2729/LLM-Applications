# Drag-and-Drop Workflow UI for LLM Applications

This is a web-based application that allows users to create and deploy workflows involving Large Language Models (LLMs). The application provides a drag-and-drop interface for constructing workflows with three essential nodes: **Input**, **LLM**, and **Output**. Users can visually connect these nodes, specify LLM configurations, and execute the workflow to process inputs and display outputs.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Users can drag and drop the **Input**, **LLM**, and **Output** nodes onto a canvas to build workflows.
- **Node Connections**: The workflow ensures proper connections:
  - Input node connects to LLM node.
  - LLM node connects to Output node.
- **Node Functionality**:
  - **Input Node**: Accepts user queries and validates input.
  - **LLM Node**: Allows users to configure OpenAI model credentials and parameters.
  - **Output Node**: Displays the output generated by the LLM based on the input.
- **Workflow Execution**: A "Run" button triggers workflow execution.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback in case of errors during workflow execution.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=16.x)
